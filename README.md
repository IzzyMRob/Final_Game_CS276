# Cosmoc Horror Adventure (Better name pending)

## Play the Game
**Unity Play Link**: N/A

## Game Overview
In 1976 Will Crowther created the game Colossal Cave Adventure, also known as Adventure. This was one of the first text-based games ever created, and it pioneered the genre of "adventure games.

In 2024 I re-created the functionality of this game for her final project in CS 151 at Willamette University under Professor Rembold. I also created my own story to go with it, chosing a Sci-Fi Horror theme instead of the original fantasy one.

Now, I am working on turning my version of this game from a text-based implementation to a 2D one.

## Extensions Implemented

### 1. Audio (2 points)
**Implementation**: I found sound assets in the Unity Store and imported them, the music just got added to the scene on a loop and the jump landing is called in the same place as the landing particle effect.
**Game Impact**: Adds immersion and feedback to the player jumps, a more upbeat feling as well.
**Technical Details**: Imported the files and added them to audio sources, one called in code and one constantly looping.
**Known Issues**: N/A
